2. Building a tailored AppSec Program using OpenSAMM by Suman Sourav & Tuyen Do<br>

'''Abstract: Building a tailored AppSec Program using OpenSAMM'''<br>
<br>
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:

• Evaluating an organization’s existing software security practices<br>
• Building a balanced software security program in well-defined iterations<br>
• Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program<br>
• Defining and measuring security-related activities within an organization<br>
<br>
This session is focused on the practical implementation of an AppSec Program based on your organization needs and business risk appetite. Most of the AppSec program fails because of lack of programmatic approach and strategic rollout. Participants will learn about an importance of a Security Program Management, how it solves people, process and technologies challenges in implementing an AppSec program, driving results and metrics relevant to the different stakeholders.<br>
